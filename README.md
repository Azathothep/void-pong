# \<pong\>
_An exploration of code aesthetic through classic Pong_

**\<pong\>** (project name: _void-pong_) is an attempt to use runtime code aesthetically in a game. This means not only visualizing it, but integrate its aesthetic deep into the graphics and game mechanics.

Inspired by Pippin Barr's [_Pongs_](https://pippinbarr.com/pongs/), it takes the form of one or multiple Pong variations.
